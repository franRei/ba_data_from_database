Warning: in word Frijjōz dagaz, ignoring line: {{sup|1}}The origin of ''frjádagr'' is unclear, but a loan from West Germanic is considered most likely, in which case Old Saxon could be the West Germanic language that gave the Old Norse form, as Old Saxon was in contact with Old Norse in the south of Denmark. A contraction of reconstructed direct descendant {{m|non||*friggjardagr}} or {{m|non||*freyjudagr}} (the latter of which would be derived from Norse god Freyja instead of Frigg), suggested by some, is phonetically implausible. The Faroese form {{m|fo|fríggjadagur}} is the result of [[skerping]], the hardening of close vowels into palatal plosives/affricates before another vowel, which is a regular development in Faroese. The vowel {{m|fo||-í-}} ([ʊi]) in {{m|fo||fríggjadagur}} as opposed to {{m|fo||-i-}} ([ɪ]) likewise shows that it cannot derive from {{m|non||*friggjardagur}}., line does not begin with just '*'s or ':'s.
